        <p>
          Here we intend to have have a list of of quick CSS Tricks. Eventually
          we will have a contents section (on this section) which will allow us to 
          easily navigate to the section that we want.
        </p>
        <p>
            This one is not numbered because we have just used it and it will eventually 
            be placed on the html page. 
        </p>
        <p class="trick tricks-1">
            When you want to format some HTML:
            Ctrl+Shift+I to format the entire file or Format Selection Ctrl+K Ctrl+F to just format the selected text.

            1. Slideout Footer technique
            <br>
            <br>
        This is called the <em>Slideout Footer</em> technique. This is crucial to having a footer
        sit neatly at the bottom of the page, and to only appear when necessary. It was taken
        from the following page: https://css-tricks.com/the-slideout-footer/.
        <br>
        <br>
        What needs to happen is that must make sure that the footer section is below the main area 
        and the main page container has the following ingredients. Now keep in mind it may be 
        that one has as header of 10vh and therefore keeps the main page container to 90vh -- we 
        need to try this we haven't tried this yet. The second image
        on the right is referring to the footer, one could also throw a top of 100%
        on there for good measure. This is crucial for our front-end mentor
        tasks so that people will know exactly how to contact us if necessary
         -- anyway here's the code:

        <div class="image-container-one three-img">

          What we can clearly see is that the grid-template is what is being used to determine 
          the design of the grid while the .two is determining the dimensions of the text in the 
          article.

        <h3>Fireship: Implicit Grid</h3>

        </div>
        <p class="exp-2">Note that auto-fit takes up all of the available space in 
          this example, auto-fill operates a bit differently and may only fill up 
          as much space as the collective width of the box-fixed-widths allows.
